If you have a Roland Stika Plus STX 8 vinyl cutter and want to use it with Windows 7, you may have trouble finding a compatible driver. Roland does not offer a supporting Windows 7 driver for this legacy product[^2^]. However, there is a workaround that may help you install the driver and use your cutter with Windows 7.
 
The workaround involves using the Dr. Stika Plus software, which is a design and cutting program that works with Roland Stika cutters[^1^]. You can download the latest version of Dr. Stika Plus from the Roland DGA website[^1^]. The software is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, and 7.

- Before cutting, make sure your blade is sharp and clean. Replace it if it is dull or damaged.
- Adjust the blade depth according to the thickness of your vinyl. A general rule of thumb is to expose the blade about half the thickness of your vinyl.
- Adjust the speed and pressure settings according to your material and design. A lower speed and pressure are recommended for intricate designs and thin materials. A higher speed and pressure are suitable for simple designs and thick materials.
- Test cut a small piece of vinyl before cutting your actual design. This will help you check if your settings are correct and avoid wasting material.
- Use a cutting mat or a backing sheet to protect your cutter and your material from scratches and damage.
- After cutting, weed out the excess vinyl from your design using a weeding tool or a pair of tweezers.
- Use a transfer tape or paper to lift your design from the backing sheet and apply it to your desired surface. Make sure to smooth out any bubbles or wrinkles with a squeegee or a credit card.
- If you are using HTV, make sure to mirror your design before cutting. After weeding, place your design on your fabric and press it with an iron or a heat press machine. Follow the instructions on the HTV package for the correct temperature and time settings.
- Clean and store your cutter properly after each use. Wipe off any dust or debris from the cutter with a soft cloth. Lubricate the blade holder and the carriage regularly with a silicone spray or oil. Cover your cutter with a dust cover or store it in a dry and cool place.
