# How to Jump Higher in IGI 2: Covert Strike
 
IGI 2: Covert Strike is a first-person shooter game that lets you play as an elite agent who has to stop World War III from happening. The game has a variety of missions that require stealth, strategy and skill. But sometimes, you might want to have some fun and jump higher than usual in the game. That's where the high jump mod comes in.
 
The high jump mod is a modification of the game files that allows you to jump much higher than normal. This can help you reach places that are otherwise inaccessible, or just enjoy the view from above. However, be careful not to fall from too high or you might die. Also, some missions might not work properly with the mod, so use it at your own risk.

To install the high jump mod, you need to download one of the modded files from this link[^1^]. Then, you need to open the HUMANPLAYER folder in your IGI 2 directory and replace the 'humanplayer.qvm' file with the modded file. Make sure you have a backup of the original file in case you want to restore it later. You can choose from different levels of jumping height, from low to extreme. Once you have replaced the file, you can launch the game and enjoy your new jumping ability.
 
The high jump mod is a fun way to spice up your IGI 2 gameplay and explore new possibilities. However, it is not an official feature of the game and might cause some glitches or errors. Use it at your own discretion and don't forget to have fun.
